Introduction

The final project for this course will assess the development of an end-to-end statistical analysis. In Module 2, you were assigned to a group by your instructor. You and your teammate(s) have worked closely to find a dataset, cleaned and prepared it for analysis, performed EDA, and produced a model. You will then produce a final technical report discussing the results of your analysis and the validity of your model. It is required that you and your team use GitHub as a code hosting platform to manage version control and collaboration during this project. It is also necessary to create and add a README file to your GitHub repository. It is recommended that you follow the PEP 8Links to an external site. â€“ Style Guide for your Python code in the final project.

For your video presentation:

Give an 8-10 minute presentation of your analysis aimed at a non-technical audience of business leaders.
Each team member should participate in the presentation equally.
Project Deliverables and Submission Format

Prepare and submit your Final Technical Report in PDF format on Blackboard. You will use the naming convention Final-Project-Report-Team-Number.pdf (e.g., Final-Project-Report-Team-1.pdf)
Prepare a recorded video presentation of your project using a screencasting tool, such as Zoom, to record your screen and provide a voice narration.
Ensure that the sound quality of your video is good and each member presents an equal portion of the presentation.
Export the video file to an mp4 format.
You may use any recording software you wish. View the Recording Video Presentation and Submission Guidelines for AAI Students.
You will use the naming convention Final-Project-Presentation-Team-Number.mp4 (e.g., Final-Project-Presentation-Team-1.mp4).
Only ONE member of your team will need to submit these deliverables. Please note that you must submit each deliverable separately. 
NOTE: Team members may not get the same grade on the Final Team Project, depending on each team member's level of contribution.
You will submit the peer evaluation form individually below in Assignment 7.1.
This assignment has TurnitinLinks to an external site. enabled for submissions which means that your instructor will obtain an Similarity Report that identifies specific parts of your writing that may indicate a high level of matching to external content. You are strongly encouraged to review your work without penalty by activating the Draft Coach extension in your Google DocsLinks to an external site. prior to submitting your work for final grading.
